Is a locally owned and operated business on the Gold Coast since 1997. After news of the old site provider coming to an end, I put my hand up to help resolve this by creating a new and modern website. With more information and a greater improvement to the previous site. This new design and infrastructure is a major upgrade and has provided an awesome learning experience: 

1. Working with a client and gathering requirements
2. Implementing best practices in a production environment
3. Learning more about AWS
4. Learning heaps of new techniques
5. Solving new problems
