                    Picture framing commenced in 1993, leading to the establishment of a dedicated
                    framing business in 1997 on Oxley Drive. In 2000, the store was relocated to 142
                    Brisbane Road, where it served the community for the subsequent two decades. A
                    significant move took place in August 2019, bringing the business to its current
                    location at 122 Brisbane Road. With nearly 60 years of collective experience in
                    the picture framing industry, the journey continues.
